# Lucene.NET API Check Utility

This utility checks the Lucene.NET API against the Lucene API for any incompatibilities.
This uses the Java-based lucene-api-exporter utility in this project (see the `src/java/lucene-api-exporter` directory).

This utility is intended to be used by Lucene.NET contributors, and is not intended to be used by Lucene.NET end users.
